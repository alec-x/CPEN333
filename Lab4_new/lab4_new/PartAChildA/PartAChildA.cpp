//	It's important to realise that all processes accessing the same datapool must

//	which would be '#include'd' into each program that used that datapool. However, for
//	simplicity, we have recreated the same template in each process

	//	whether the datapool exists or not yet (we know that it does because we only
	//	set the process running after the parent program had created it and stored data
	//	in it) but that shouldn't matter, since the program can just attempt to make it. If it already exists
	//	then it will simply use it. If it doesn't exist, then it will be created below

	// In order to access the data pool, we need a pointer to its location in memory. This is what
	// the LinkDataPool() primitive does as we saw in the parent program

	//	struct mydatapooldata 	 *MyDataPool = (struct mydatapooldata *)(0x1000) ;    // just to show an error

	struct mydatapooldata 	 *MyDataPool = (struct mydatapooldata *)(dp.LinkDataPool());

	// The CDatapool object 'dp' created at the start of the program will now be destroyed
