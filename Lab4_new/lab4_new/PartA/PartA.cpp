// Let's suppose the data we want to put in the datapool is complex, i.e not just a simple
// int or char. The easiest way to store complex data is to introduce a structure template
// describing the names and types of the data we wich to group together as shown below
//  which includes three variables, two simple integers and an array of 10 integers

struct 	    mydatapooldata {		// start of structure template

	//	we are creating, which can then be shared by all other processes in the system
	//	Note that we do not have to worry about which of the many processes using the datapool will
	//	actually make it, because when a request is made to make a datapool, the operating system 
	//	checks to see if it exists or not. If not, then the pool will be made, otherwise the process
	//	will simply 'use' the pool if it finds it already exists.
	//
	//	Note we also have to specify the size of the datapool we are making and because we want it
	//	to hold the data in the structure template above, we make it that big

	// In order to access the data pool, we need a pointer to its location in memory. This is what
	// the LinkDataPool() primitive does. It gives us back a pointer to the data pool referred to by 'dp'.
	// Note that because the operating system doesn't know the purpose of our datapool, i.e. what data
	// we are going to put in it, we have to 'cast' or 'convert' the actual pointer returned into a pointer
	// to the data we want to store inside the datapool, i.e. convert it to a pointer to the structure
	// mydatapooldata. Hence the pointer MyDataPool below is a pointer to a structure that we
	// want to map onto the datapool


	//	struct mydatapooldata 	 *MyDataPool = (struct mydatapooldata *)(0x1000) ;    // just to show an error
